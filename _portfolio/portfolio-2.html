title: "Modelling the short- and long-term impacts of adolescent social interventions across Africa"
excerpt: "I have been leading research to simulate the impacts, economic returns, and cost-effectiveness of scaling up evidence-based social interventions for adolescent wellbeing in collaboration with Governments in Kenya and Nigeria supported by the Gates Foundation and Wellspring Foundation. 
In Kenya, This research has supported the design of a new adolescent cash ‘plus’ programme to be integrated within the national safety net system, Inua Jamii.
In Nigeria this research is linked to informing the state-level adoption of an evidence-based economic support ‘plus’ safe spaces intervention for adolescent girls across the North of the country, focused on delaying child marriage and reducing its associated health consequences, including intimate partner violence and adolescent pregnancy.
