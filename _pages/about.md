Iâ€™m a global health researcher at the University of Oxford, specialising in social interventions to improve child and adolescent wellbeing in Africa. I work with UNICEF, the Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and governments to design, evaluate, and model interventions, with a particular focus on community health workers and cash transfers. My research has led to over 30 publications, major policy reports, and partnerships that inform programmes reducing inequalities and improving health.
