I am a senior postdoctoral researcher in global health at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Department of Social Policy and Intervention ([DSPI](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/)), a Research Associate at the University of Cape Town's Centre for Social Science Research ([CSSR](https://humanities.uct.ac.za/cssr)), and a Research Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford. 

I specialise in social interventions to improve child and adolescent wellbeing in Africa, with a particular focus on cash transfers and community health workers.

I work with the [Accelerate Research Hub](https://www.acceleratehub.org/) as well as global impact partners including UNICEF, the Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and government ministries in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.

My research has led to over 30 publications, major policy reports, and partnerships that inform programmes reducing inequalities and improving child and adolescent health.
